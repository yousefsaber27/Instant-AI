In Python, a variable name ending with an underscore (_) often serves as a convention to convey certain meanings or to avoid conflicts.

1. Avoiding Conflicts with Keywords:
When a variable name would otherwise conflict with a Python keyword, appending an underscore can make the name valid.

class_ = "This is a class"
def_ = "This is a definition"

Here, class and def are Python keywords, so appending an underscore allows you to use them as variable names.
